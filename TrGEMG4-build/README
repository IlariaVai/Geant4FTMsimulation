Geant4 application to study x-ray interactions in an FTM detector.
The application was developed with geant4.9.6.p02. 

The source files are placed in the TrGEMG4/trunk directory.
The main file is  TrGEMG4.cc, were you can set the physics list (we use FTFP_BERT_HP),
the DetectorConstruction class and the PrimaryGeneratorAction class.

The geometry is described in the GasDetectorConstructor class. It consists of a stack of 10 x 10 cm^2 foils of different
materials and thickness, laying on the xy plane:

- FakeBottom - 0.01 mm thick air layer (it's a "fake detector" used to register particles reaching the detector surface)
- FR4_1 - 500 um thick FR4 foil
- Cu  -  35 um Cu foil
- FR4_2 - 200 um thick FR4 foil
- FakeTop - 0.01 mm thick air layer (similar to FakeBottom)

The center of the coordinate system is placed at the center of FakeBottom external surface.  
All the volumes are defined as sensitive detectors. Particle steps whithin these volumes are processed by the
GasGapSensitiveDetector class, that extracts useful informations that will be registered in the output file. 

At present only one generator is implemented in the application, named ParallelPrimaryGeneratorActionScan. For each event, 
a gamma particle is fired from (0,0,-1*mm) towards the detector surface along the z axis and will impact ortogonally at the
center of the detector. The energy of the primary particle is set at runtime through the FTMsimulation.mac file
(for the moment it is set at 22.5 keV). 

Instructions to run: 
Modify the file paths contained in the following files to make them consistent with your environment:
- TrGEMG4-build/build.sh

Move in the TrGEMG4-build directory and compile the application by doing
>./build.sh 
>make

To run do
>./TrGEMG4 FTMsimulation.mac

Notice that  FTMsimulation.mac contains the settings for the tracking cuts, the number of events per run, the primary
particle energy. It is important to set the cut for protons to 0 if you deal with neutrons.  

In the output root file (task.root) you can find a tree MyRun containing:

*  Edep - it's an array with 3 elements, containing the total energy deposited in the event inside FR4_1, Cu and FR4_2 respectively. 
*  primaryAcceptance - it's a boolean that is set to 1 if the primary particle has reached the FakeBottom, 0 otherwise. In this
configuration it must be always one, but in case of more complex sources it can be used to define acceptance.
*  eleGap - it's a boolean that is set to 1 if there is at least one electron reaching the FakeTop (i.e. potentially a signal
inside the detector gas gap), 0 otherwise.  
*  chargeGap - it's a boolean that is set to 1 if there is at least one charged particle reaching the FakeTop (i.e. potentially a signal
inside the detector gas gap), 0 otherwise.  
*  primaryEne - the energy of the primary particle when entering the FakeBottom
*  primaryPosX, primaryPosY, primaryPosZ - position of primary particle when entering the FakeBottom
*  primaryPX, primaryPY, primaryPZ - momentum components of the  primary particle when entering the FakeBottom
*  primaryPdirX, primaryPdirY, primaryPdirZ - momentum direction components of the  primary particle when entering the FakeBottom
*  zAbsorption - z coordinate where the primary gamma gets absorbed. If it is not absorbed, it is set to -5 mm. 
*  volAbsorption - name of the volume where the primary gamma gets absorbed. If it is not absorbed, it is set to "none"
*  Vectors storing informations of the particles steps. A step is registered only if it is the first step of a particle in a new
volume. Therefore, for instance, a gamma that goes through the detector without iteractions will appear in five steps, one for each
sensitive volumes.   
  - TrackIndex (track nunber, for the primary particle it is equal to 1)
  - TrackPart (particle pdgId) 
  - TrackParent (track number of the mother)  
  - TrackIsPrimary ( -1 for the primary particle, 1 for particles that have been generated directly by the primary particle, 0 for
  particles generated in secondary processes) 
  - TrackGenProcess ( process that generated the particle, according to the Geant4 naming convention. )
  - TrackGenVolume (logical volume where the particle was generated) 
  - TrackGenZ (z coordinate where the particle was generated) 
  - TrackVolume (volume of the step )
  - TrackEne (kinetinc energy of the particle at  the step)
  - TrackPosX, TrackPosY, TrackPosZ (position of the step)
  - TrackPX, TrackPY, TrackPZ ( momentum of the particle at the step)
  - TrackPdirX, TrackPdirY, TrackPdirZ ( momentum direction of the particle at the step)
 
 The script runThickscan.sh automatically produces different runs varying the thickness of the FR4_1 layer. You'll have to correct
 the path of the GasDetectorConstruction.cc file to make it work.
 The macro runFTManalysis.C is an example that shows how to read the task.root file, access useful information and produce some plots.
